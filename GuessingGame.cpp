/*
  1. No global variables. (Global constants are all right.)

2. No strings. Not ever. (You can use cstrings/character arrays, and the cstrin\
g and cctype libraries are okay. In fact, I recommend using strcmp and strlen i\
n your projects.)

3. You should include <iostream>, not stdio. (This applies more to C programmer\
s.)
